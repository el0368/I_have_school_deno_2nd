CONCEPT CHAIN - WHAT BUILDS ON WHAT
================================================================================

STEP 1: MIDDLE SCHOOL PHYSICS
  What you learn:
    - What is motion? Speed, velocity, acceleration (qualitative)
    - Forces: pushes, pulls, friction, gravity (conceptual)
    - Energy: kinetic, potential, conservation (intro)
    - Waves: properties, light, sound (intro)
  Why first:
    - Builds intuition before math-heavy physics
    - No algebra required, just arithmetic

STEP 2: HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS
  What you learn:
    - Kinematics equations (d = vt, v = at, etc.)
    - Newton's 3 laws (quantitative)
    - Momentum and collisions
    - Gravitational force (F = Gm1m2/r^2)
    - Electrostatics intro
    - Energy conservation with numbers
    - Electromagnetic radiation
    - Nuclear physics intro
  Why second:
    - Applies algebra to the concepts from Step 1
    - First time doing physics with real equations

STEP 3: AP PHYSICS 1 (Mechanics deep dive)
  What you learn:
    - Kinematics in 2D (projectile motion)
    - Free body diagrams and complex force problems
    - Work, energy, power (with calculus concepts)
    - Impulse-momentum theorem
    - Torque and rotational dynamics
    - Simple harmonic motion and oscillations
    - Fluid mechanics (pressure, buoyancy)
  Why third:
    - Deepens the mechanics from Step 2
    - College-level rigor and problem-solving
    - Requires strong algebra and trigonometry

STEP 4: AP PHYSICS 2 (Everything else)
  What you learn:
    - Thermodynamics (heat, entropy, ideal gas law)
    - Electric fields and Gauss's law
    - Electric potential and capacitors
    - DC circuits (Kirchhoff's laws)
    - Magnetic fields and electromagnetic induction
    - Geometric and physical optics
    - Quantum phenomena and nuclear physics
  Why last:
    - Most abstract topics in introductory physics
    - Builds on E&M concepts from Steps 2-3
    - Requires comfort with physics problem-solving


================================================================================
MATH YOU NEED FOR EACH STEP
================================================================================

Step 1 (Middle School Physics):
  - Arithmetic, fractions, decimals
  - Basic graphing (reading charts)
  - Ratios and proportions

Step 2 (High School Physics):
  - Algebra 1 (solving equations, graphing lines)
  - Basic geometry (angles, area)
  - Scientific notation

Step 3 (AP Physics 1):
  - Algebra 2 (quadratics, systems of equations)
  - Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan, vectors)
  - Comfortable manipulating equations

Step 4 (AP Physics 2):
  - Same as Step 3
  - Basic understanding of logarithms (helpful)
  - Exponential functions (helpful)


================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

1. AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 can technically be taken in either order.
   However, AP Physics 1 (mechanics) is recommended first because:
   - Mechanics concepts (force, energy) appear everywhere in physics
   - Problem-solving skills transfer to AP Physics 2
   - Most schools teach them in this order

2. These are all ALGEBRA-BASED physics courses. Khan Academy does not
   currently offer calculus-based physics (the equivalent of university
   Physics I & II for science/engineering majors).

3. If you want calculus-based physics, study AP Calculus AB/BC alongside
   or before AP Physics 1 & 2.

4. Khan Academy also has a separate "Cosmology and Astronomy" course
   under science, but it is not included here as it is not part of the
   core physics curriculum.
