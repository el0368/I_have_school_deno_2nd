NOTES
================================================================================

1. "Arithmetic" and "Basic Geometry & Measurement" are supplemental courses.
   They cover the SAME topics as Grades 3-8 but organized by topic instead
   of grade. Use them for extra practice if you need it.

2. You do NOT need both AP Calculus AB and BC. BC includes all of AB plus
   extra topics. Pick one:
   - AB = first semester college calculus
   - BC = first + second semester college calculus

3. "College Algebra" overlaps heavily with Algebra 2 and Precalculus.
   It's meant for college students who need a refresher. Skip if you
   already completed Algebra 2 + Precalculus.

4. Statistics and AP Statistics can be taken at any point after Algebra 1.
   They don't require Calculus.

5. Linear Algebra and Differential Equations can be taken in either order
   after Calculus 2. Some programs teach them simultaneously.

6. Calculus 3 (Multivariable) and the separate Multivariable Calculus file
   cover the same material. Use whichever has more detail.
