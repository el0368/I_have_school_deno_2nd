WHY THIS ORDER? (CONCEPT CHAIN EXPLAINED)
================================================================================

STEP 1: COUNTING & NUMBER SENSE
  What: Recognizing numbers, counting objects, comparing quantities
  Why first: Everything in math starts with understanding numbers
  Covers: Kindergarten → Grade 8

STEP 2: ADDITION
  What: Combining quantities, regrouping, multi-digit, decimal addition
  Why next: First operation — extends counting by "how many altogether?"
  Needs: Step 1 (you must know numbers to add them)

STEP 3: SUBTRACTION
  What: Taking away, finding differences, borrowing
  Why next: Inverse of addition — "how many are left?"
  Needs: Steps 1-2

STEP 4: PLACE VALUE & DECIMALS
  What: Ones/tens/hundreds, expanded form, decimal notation
  Why next: Needed before multi-digit multiplication/division
  Needs: Steps 1-3

STEP 5: MULTIPLICATION
  What: Repeated addition, times tables, multi-digit, properties
  Why next: Builds on addition, needs place value for large numbers
  Needs: Steps 1-4

STEP 6: DIVISION
  What: Sharing equally, long division, remainders
  Why next: Inverse of multiplication
  Needs: Steps 1-5

STEP 7: FRACTIONS
  What: Parts of wholes, equivalent fractions, fraction operations
  Why next: Combines division concept with place value understanding
  Needs: Steps 4-6 (fractions ARE division: 3/4 means 3 ÷ 4)

STEP 8: MEASUREMENT, MONEY & TIME
  What: Length, weight, volume, coins, clocks, unit conversion
  Why here: Applies basic operations to real-world contexts
  Needs: Steps 1-6 (measurement uses all four operations)
  Note: Practical topic — can be studied alongside Steps 5-7

STEP 9: GEOMETRY
  What: Shapes, angles, area, volume, transformations, proofs
  Why next: Applies all prior arithmetic to spatial reasoning
  Needs: Steps 1-8 (area = multiplication, perimeter = addition)

STEP 10: DATA & GRAPHS
  What: Bar graphs, line plots, histograms, scatter plots
  Why here: Reading and creating data displays uses counting and operations
  Needs: Steps 1-6 (basic operations for interpreting data)
  Note: Can be studied alongside Steps 7-9

STEP 11: RATIOS, RATES & PROPORTIONS
  What: Comparing quantities, unit rates, proportional reasoning
  Why next: Bridge between arithmetic and algebra
  Needs: Steps 5-7 (ratios are fractions in context)

STEP 12: EXPONENTS & RADICALS
  What: Powers, exponent rules, roots, scientific notation
  Why here: Extends multiplication to repeated multiplication
  Needs: Steps 5-6 (exponents are repeated multiplication)
  Note: Can be studied alongside Steps 11, 13, 14

STEP 13: NEGATIVE NUMBERS
  What: Number line, ordering, operations with negatives
  Why here: Extends the number system below zero
  Needs: Steps 1-6 (all four operations, now with sign rules)
  Note: Can be studied alongside Steps 11, 12, 14

STEP 14: PATTERNS & SEQUENCES
  What: Shape patterns, number patterns, sequences, series
  Why here: Bridge from arithmetic patterns to algebraic thinking
  Needs: Steps 1-6 (patterns use operations and number sense)

STEP 15: ALGEBRA & EQUATIONS
  What: Variables, expressions, linear/quadratic/polynomial equations
  Why next: Generalizes ALL prior arithmetic into abstract reasoning
  Needs: Steps 1-14 (algebra is arithmetic with unknowns)

STEP 16: FUNCTIONS
  What: Input/output, graphing, function types, transformations
  Why next: Formalizes algebraic relationships as mappings
  Needs: Step 15 (functions are equations with structure)

STEP 17: TRIGONOMETRY
  What: Sine/cosine/tangent, unit circle, identities, graphing
  Why next: Connects geometry (triangles) with algebra (functions)
  Needs: Steps 9, 15-16 (trig = geometry + functions)

STEP 18: STATISTICS & PROBABILITY
  What: Data analysis, distributions, inference, combinatorics
  Why here: Needs fractions, ratios, data skills, and some algebra
  Needs: Steps 7, 10-11, 15
  Note: Can be studied alongside Steps 16-17

STEP 19: CALCULUS
  What: Limits, derivatives, integrals, series, multivariable
  Why last: Combines ALL previous topics at the highest level
  Needs: Steps 15-17 (requires strong algebra, functions, and trig)

HOW TO USE by_topics vs by_grade
================================================================================

  by_grade/ files answer:  "I'm in Grade 7 — what should I practice?"
  by_topics/ files answer: "I want to master fractions from K to college."

USE by_topics WHEN:
  - You're weak in one area and want to trace it from the beginning
  - You want to see how a concept evolves across all grade levels
  - You're an adult learner filling in gaps
  - You're a tutor mapping a student's skill gaps

USE by_grade WHEN:
  - You're following a school curriculum grade by grade
  - You want exact Khan Academy exercise names to practice
  - You need quizzes and unit tests listed
  - You want a complete course, not just one topic
