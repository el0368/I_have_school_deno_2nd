# Rust-WASM: The Markdown Version

This page is the **MDX** version of the Rust demo. Notice how much cleaner the 
source code is compared to the `.tsx` version!

## 1. The Interactive Island
Below is the same Rust engine we used before, but now it is embedded directly 
into a Markdown document.

<div class="my-8">
  <RustCounter />

## 2. Why is this different?

## 3. The "Auto" Confusion

You asked: *"Why do I have to register MDX but not TSX?"*

It comes down to who is "driving" the search:

1. **The Framework (Fresh)**: Fresh was built by the Deno team to recognize `.tsx` 
   files automatically. It's "hard-coded" to love those files.
   
2. **Our Extension (MDX)**: Fresh doesn't know what MDX is by default. We added 
   a "Custom Catch-all" in your `main.ts`. Because we don't want Deno searching 
   the entire hard drive on every single click (which is slow), we tell it to 
   check your "Approved List" in `mdx-routes.ts` instead.

**Think of it like this:**
- `.tsx` is the **Main Entrance** of the building (anyone can walk in).
- `.mdx` is a **Private Club** (you have to be on the guest list in `mdx-routes.ts`).
