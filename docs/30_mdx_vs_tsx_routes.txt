MDX & TSX: THE "SEQUENTIAL CHECK"
================================================================================

I hear your confusion! Let's clear it up by looking at the "Brains" of your 
website ([main.ts](file:///c:/GitHub/I_have_school_deno_2nd/main.ts)).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. THE TWO-STEP PROCESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a user visits a link (like `/rust-wasm`), Deno starts a "Search":

- STEP 1 (The Default): [Line 32](file:///c:/GitHub/I_have_school_deno_2nd/main.ts#L32) 
  `app.fsRoutes();`
  Deno looks for a `.tsx` file in your `routes/` folder. 
  "Is there a rust-wasm.tsx?" -> **FOUND!** -> Search stops, page shown.

- STEP 2 (The Extension): [Line 35](file:///c:/GitHub/I_have_school_deno_2nd/main.ts#L35)
  `app.get("*", ...)`
  If Step 1 found nothing, Deno then looks at your **MDX Registry**.
  "Is there a /testmdx in the registry?" -> **FOUND!** -> Page shown.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. WHY KEEP .TSX?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are right that we *could* do everything in MDX. But `.tsx` is like a "Custom 
Suit"—it fits perfectly because you build it line-by-line using pure code. 

- `rust-wasm.tsx`: Uses custom CSS, specific layouts, and a "Start to Finish" 
  design that would be hard to do in Markdown.
- `testmdx.mdx`: Is for when you want to write **text** fast without 
  worrying about HTML tags.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:
We have **NOT** removed TSX. We have **EXTENDED** Fresh so that it can 
understand BOTH. 

- TSX = The Base Framework (App logic)
- MDX = The Plugin (Content writing)

You can choose whichever one is better for the specific page you are making!
