MDX3: HTML + ISLANDS
================================================================================

You have summarized it perfectly! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. THE CONVERSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Deno looks at your `.mdx` file, it does a "Double Transformation":

1. MDX -> PREACT: It turns your markdown text into a Preact component.
2. PREACT -> HTML: It renders that component into static HTML on the server.

So, by the time the user's browser sees your page, **the entire MDX file has 
become a standard HTML page.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. THE "ISLANDS" IN THE STREAM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just like a standard HTML page, your MDX-generated page is "dead" by default. 
It only becomes "alive" if you explicitly drop an Island into it:

- THE PAGE (The Ocean): All your markdown text, headings, and math. 
  This stays as static, high-performance HTML.
- THE ISLANDS (The Interactive Parts): Components from the /islands/ folder. 
  These are the only parts that ship JavaScript to the user.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. WHY THIS IS SO COOL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This means you get the best of both worlds:

- YOU WRITE: Easy markdown text.
- THE BROWSER LOADS: Fast, static HTML.
- THE USER GETS: Complex, interactive tools (Islands) right inside the text.

SUMMARY:
A page created with MDX3 is **100% equivalent** to a page created with a standard 
`.tsx` file. Both result in a static HTML page where only the "Islands" are 
interactive.
