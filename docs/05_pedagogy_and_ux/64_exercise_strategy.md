### Strategy for Sovereign Academy Practice Exercises

#### 1. The Multi-Engine "Relay" Architecture

No single library covers the full educational spectrum. The system functions as
a relay where the backend routes requests to the appropriate engine based on the
grade level and complexity:

- **The Fast Path (High Volume):** For instant answer-checking, the Rust backend
  utilizes **SymEngine (C++)**. It performs symbolic equivalence checks in
  milliseconds to provide immediate feedback.
- **The Deep Path (Pedagogical):** When a student clicks "Show Steps," the
  system calls **SymPy Gamma (Python via PyO3)**. This generates the
  human-readable, step-by-step derivations needed for learning.
- **The Foundation & Peak:** Basic arithmetic (K-8) is handled by **Mathsteps
  (WASM)** on the client-side to save server costs, while PhD-level reasoning
  uses **Lean 4 or Z3** for formal proof verification.

#### 2. The Six Exercise Tiers

A lesson should not use every type, but rather a mix that fits the specific
learning objective:

1. **Conceptual Check (Multiple Choice):** Tests the "Why" before the "How."
2. **Fluency Drill (Numeric Fill-in-the-Blank):** Builds speed with basic
   calculations.
3. **Algebraic Solver (Symbolic Input):** Uses a math keypad to test variable
   manipulation.
4. **Logical Sequence (Ordered Steps):** Scrambles the steps of a solved problem
   for the student to reorder.
5. **Scribble Submission (Handwriting):** Converts iPad/iPhone drawings into
   LaTeX using OCR (like Mathpix or MyScript) for natural solving.
6. **Axiomatic Step (Formal Proof):** PhD-level interaction where students apply
   logical tactics to prove theorems.

#### 3. Infinite Generation via Blueprints

To avoid managing millions of static files, exercises are authored as
**Blueprints** within MDX files:

- **Procedural Blueprints:** Instead of static numbers, questions use variables
  with defined constraints (e.g., `Solve for x: [A]x + [B] = [C]`).
- **Seed-Based Randomization:** Each practice session generates a unique "Seed."
  This seed determines the random numbers for the variables, allowing for
  infinite variations of the same problem type while remaining reproducible.
- **Working Backwards:** High-quality problems are generated by picking the
  answer first (e.g., $x=5$) and building the equation around it to ensure
  clean, logical results.

#### 4. The "Scribble" Input Ecosystem

Using Tauri, the app enables a cross-platform writing experience:

- **Handshake Protocol:** An iPad or iPhone can pair with a PC/Laptop to act as
  a high-precision digital scratchpad.
- **Stroke Recognition:** Raw pen coordinates are tracked and converted into
  typeset LaTeX in real-time.
- **Verification:** The converted LaTeX string is sent to the Rust/SymPy
  backend, which treats the handwritten work as a standard symbolic answer for
  validation.
