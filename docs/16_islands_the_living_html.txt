ISLAND ARCHITECTURE: DEAD VS. ALIVE
================================================================================

To answer your question: It's not quite "Whatever is not HTML is an Island." 
Actually, **everything in Fresh arrives at the browser as HTML.**

The real difference is whether that HTML is "Dead" or "Alive."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. THE "DEAD" PARTS (ROUTES & COMPONENTS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- WHAT HAPPENS: Deno calculates the logic on the server and generates HTML.
- THE RESULT: The browser receives pure, static HTML.
- INTERACTION: If you click something, nothing happens (unless it's a link).
- METAPHOR: Like a printed photo. You can see it, but it doesn't move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. THE "ALIVE" PARTS (ISLANDS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- WHAT HAPPENS: Deno generates the initial HTML (so you see it fast), BUT 
  it also sends a bundle of **JavaScript** (and potentially **WASM**) 
  to the browser.
- THE RESULT: The browser receives HTML + code to execute.
- HYDRATION: The browser "hydrates" that HTML, turning it into a living, 
  breathing component.
- METAPHOR: Like a video on an iPad. It looks like a photo at first, but 
  you can touch it and interact with it.

3. SUMMARY COMPARISON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Feature             | Static (Route/Component) | Island (Interactive)         |
|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Arrives as HTML?    | Yes!                     | Yes!                         |
| Sends Code (JS/WASM)| No.                      | Yes!                         |
| Can use `onClick`?  | No.                      | Yes!                         |
| Speed               | Extremely Fast           | Very Fast (Small overhead)   |
| Use for...          | Text, Layout, SEO        | Buttons, Games, Simulators   |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. PARTIAL HYDRATION (THE "ISLAND" CONCEPT)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You understood it perfectly! You don't set the entire page as an Island.

- THE OCEAN: The majority of your page is static HTML (text, layout, images). 
  This stays "dead" and fast.
- THE ISLAND: You only place small, interactive "Islands" (buttons, forms, 
  simulators) exactly where you need them.

This way, the browser only has to download and run code for those tiny 
islands, not the whole giant page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. WHAT ABOUT C++, C#, OR RUST?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You asked: "What if C++ or C# is part of an island?" 

Great catch! My previous note said "only JavaScript," but **WASM** is the 
exception. Here is how those languages become "Alive":

1. THE SOURCE: You write high-performance code in C++, C#, or Rust.
2. THE BINARY: You compile that code into a `.wasm` file.
3. THE GLUE: You use a tiny bit of JavaScript inside an Island to load and 
   run that `.wasm` file.

So, while JavaScript is the "Native Tongue" of the browser, WASM is the 
"Power Engine" that allows you to bring C++, C#, or Rust logic into 
the "Alive" parts of your website.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION:
"Islands" are the only parts of your website that use running code (JS or WASM) 
in the user's browser. Everything else is just high-performance, static HTML.
