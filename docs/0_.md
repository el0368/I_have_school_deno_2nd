To be brutally honest: **Attempting to build and maintain both systems is
software suicide for a solo developer or small team.** You must drop the old way
entirely and commit 100% to the generative, instant-feedback model.

Here is the realistic, unvarnished truth about why keeping both is a terrible
idea for your specific project.

### 1. The Database Nightmare

Supporting both paradigms ruins your backend architecture.

- **The New Way (Generative):** Your database only needs to track an integer. It
  looks at the user and says, _"Streak = 3/5 for Addition."_ It is incredibly
  lightweight.
- **The Old Way (Static):** You have to build massive relational tables to store
  the text of Question 1, the text of Question 2, the four multiple-choice
  options for each, the correct answer key, and the user's specific selection
  for every single question.

If you build both, your `db/schema.ts` will become a bloated, convoluted mess.
You will spend half your development time just writing logic to figure out
_which_ database table a specific lesson is supposed to read from.

### 2. The Maintenance Multiplier

Every time you want to add a feature—like a new "Show Hint" button, or an
animation when they get something right, or a new LaTeX rendering library—you
will have to code it twice. You will have to build it into the `<StaticQuiz />`
component and then build it again into the `<PracticeIsland />` component. You
will inevitably update one, forget to update the other, and your application
will break.

### 3. Extraneous Cognitive Load (The Empirical Science)

From a pedagogical and psychological standpoint, mixing interaction models
actively harms the student.

According to John Sweller's highly validated **Cognitive Load Theory**, any
mental effort a student spends trying to understand _how_ to use a software
interface is "extraneous cognitive load"—brain power wasted that should have
been spent on doing the actual math.

If a student learns that your platform gives instant, immediate feedback, their
brain adapts to that rhythm. If they click to the next page and suddenly face a
static, 20-question worksheet where they have to wait until the end to see if
they are right, it creates massive psychological friction. It is jarring,
frustrating, and destroys the "flow state" required for a high-speed mastery
track.

### 4. The Content Creation Bottleneck

If you allow the "old way" to exist in your codebase, you will eventually be
tempted to use it. You will find yourself wasting 4 hours typing out 20
individual static math problems in an MDX file.

By hardcoding your platform to _only_ accept generative blueprints, you force
yourself to be an engineer. You write the rule once ($Ax + B = C$), and the Rust
engine handles the rest forever.

### The Verdict

Burn the boats. Do not write a single line of code for the old, static way.

Every single exercise in the Sovereign Academy should be a single Preact
component (`<PracticeIsland />`) injected at the bottom of the MDX lesson that
generates infinite questions and demands a streak of 5 to pass. This keeps your
codebase pristine, your database tiny, and the student experience flawless.
