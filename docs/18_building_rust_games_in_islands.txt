BUILDING RUST GAMES IN ISLANDS
================================================================================

You've hit the nail on the head! This is exactly what the Island Architecture 
is for. You can build a high-performance game in **Rust**, compile it, and 
run it inside a small section of your page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. THE GAME ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- THE ENGINE (Rust): 
  Calculates the physics, high-speed logic, and game state.
- THE RENDERER (Canvas/Webgl): 
  The area on the screen where the game is drawn.
- THE HOST (Island): 
  A Preact Island that sets up the game area and connects the user's 
  keyboard/mouse to the Rust engine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. HOW IT LOOKS IN YOUR CODE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine you want a small "Asteroids" game in the middle of a lesson:

1. RUST SIDE: You write your game loops in Rust and compile to `game.wasm`.
2. ISLAND SIDE: You create `islands/RustGame.tsx`. Inside, you have a 
   `<canvas id="game-screen"></canvas>`.
3. THE LINK: The Island's TypeScript code grabs the `<canvas>` and "hands" it 
   to the Rust WASM module.
4. THE RESULT: Rust now has total control over that rectangle on your screen!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. WHY THIS IS BETTER THAN "TRADITIONAL" WEB GAMES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- SPEED: Rust is much faster for calculating 100s of moving objects or 
  complex collisions.
- ISOLATION: The game runs in its own "Island." If the game is heavy, it 
  won't slow down the scrolling of the rest of your text/lesson.
- CONTENT-FIRST: You can write a whole article in MDX, and then just drop in:
  `<RustGame difficulty="hard" />`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION:
Islands are the perfect "cradles" for WASM-powered content like games, 
scientific simulators, or 3D models. You get the speed of Rust with the 
easy layout of MDX!
