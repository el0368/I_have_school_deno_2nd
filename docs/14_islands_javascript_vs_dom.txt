ISLANDS: JAVASCRIPT VS. DOM
================================================================================

To answer your question: An Island file is a hybrid. It is written in 
**JavaScript (TypeScript)**, but its main job is to control the **DOM**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. THE BALANCING ACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- IT IS JAVASCRIPT (Logic): 
  When you see `onClick={() => props.count.value += 1}`, that is pure 
  JavaScript logic. It tells the computer *what to do* when a button is 
  pressed.

- IT DESCRIBES THE DOM (Structure): 
  When you see `<div>`, `<p>`, or `<button>`, you are describing the 
  Document Object Model (DOM). You are telling the browser *what to show*.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. WHY THE "ISLAND" FOLDER IS SPECIAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Fresh, most of your website is "Dead HTML" (Static DOM). It looks like 
the DOM, but if you click it, nothing happens because there is no JavaScript 
attached to it.

The **Islands** folder is the only place where the DOM is "Alive":

- SERVER-SIDE: Deno renders the Island into HTML so the user sees it 
  instantly (The DOM).
- CLIENT-SIDE: The browser then attaches the JavaScript logic to that HTML. 
  This process is called **Hydration**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. THE VIRTUAL DOM BRIDGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You don't usually write raw DOM commands like `document.getElementById()`. 
Instead, you use **Preact** (which lives in your `.tsx` files). Preact acts 
as a "Bridge":

1. You write JavaScript logic (The Brain).
2. You write JSX tags (The Body/DOM).
3. Preact automatically updates the DOM whenever your JavaScript data 
   changes.

SUMMARY:
An Island is the "Brain" (JavaScript) and the "Body" (DOM) joined together. 
Without the Island folder, your website would have a Body but no Brain.
