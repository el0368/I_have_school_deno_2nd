SERVER JSX VS. CLIENT ISLANDS: THE PERFORMANCE SECRET
================================================================================

You have raised a brilliant point! If the entire page was a JavaScript "Island," 
it would indeed be very heavy. 

But here is the "Secret Sauce" of Fresh: **JSX on the server is NOT the same 
as an Island on the client.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. THE SERVER-SIDE "FILTER"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- THE WORK: Deno compiles your MDX into JSX and runs it on the server.
- THE FILTER: Once the JSX produces the HTML, Fresh "throws away" the 
  JavaScript logic for everything *except* the Islands.
- THE RESULT: The browser only receives the **Static HTML**. It never sees 
   the complex JSX code that created it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. WHY YOUR PAGE STAYS LIGHTWEIGHT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine your MDX page has 10,000 words. 

- TRADITIONAL APPS: Would send 10,000 words as a JavaScript bundle. (Heavy!)
- FRESH APPS: Sends 10,000 words as pure, compressed HTML text. (Light!)

The browser doesn't have to download the "JSX code" for your text. It only 
downloads the "The result of the JSX" (the HTML). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. WHEN DOES IT GET HEAVY?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The page only gets "heavy" if you put too much stuff in the `/islands/` folder. 
Because Islands *must* ship their JavaScript to the browser, they are the 
only parts that contribute to your "JavaScript weight."

| component type      | Runs on Server | Runs in Browser | Ships JavaScript? |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| MDX Route           | YES            | NO              | NO                |
| Regular Component   | YES            | NO              | NO                |
| Island Component    | YES            | **YES**         | **YES**           |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION:
Even though your MDX is "JavaScript under the hood," that JavaScript stays 
safely on the **Server**. The user only gets the "lightweight" HTML result. 
This is why you can have massive MDX pages that still load in milliseconds!
