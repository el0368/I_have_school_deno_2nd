TAURI + FRESH: THE DESKTOP FRONTIER
================================================================================

You asked: *"Will Tauri work in this project?"*

The short answer is: **Yes, absolutely!** 

In fact, the way we have set up this project (Fresh 2.0 + Vite) makes it MUCH 
easier to add Tauri than older versions of Fresh. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. HOW IT WOULD WORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tauri doesn't "replace" your project; it "Wraps" it.

- **The Front (Fresh)**: Your HTML, CSS, and Preact Islands stay exactly as 
  they are. They become the "Interface" of your desktop app.
- **The Back (Tauri/Rust)**: Tauri would create a new folder called `src-tauri`. 
  This is where the "Native" Rust code lives.
- **The Bridge**: Your current Rust WASM code in `/wasm/` could be moved or 
  linked so that the desktop app can use it directly without needing the 
  browser's permission.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. WHY FRESH 2.0 + VITE IS A "SECRET WEAPON"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tauri loves **Vite**. Because Fresh 2.0 uses Vite for its build process, 
connecting Tauri is straightforward. Tauri would simply listen to your 
`deno task dev` (Vite) server and display it inside a native window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. WHAT WOULD CHANGE?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you added Tauri, you would get new "Superpowers":
- **File System**: Your schoool app could save files directly to the 
  user's "My Documents" folder.
- **Native Menus**: You could have real Windows/Mac menus at the top.
- **System Tray**: Your app could sit in the taskbar next to the clock.
- **Performance**: Rust would talk to the CPU directly, not through a 
  "Guest" (WASM) layer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:
You are in a perfect position to move to Tauri later. 
- **Website version**: Fresh runs on Deno (Web).
- **Desktop version**: Fresh runs inside Tauri (Native).

You could literally have the **same code** serve both a website and a 
downloadable `.exe` file!
