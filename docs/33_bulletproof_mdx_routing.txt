BULLETPROOF MDX: THE UPGRADED ROUTER
================================================================================

We have upgraded the MDX routing system to be more robust, automatic, and 
developer-friendly. Here is what changed:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. AUTO-DISCOVERY (No more manual registration)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Old way**: Every time you added a `.mdx` file, you had to manually type 
  its name into `mdx-routes.ts`.
- **New way**: `mdx-routes.ts` now uses `import.meta.glob("./routes/**/*.mdx")`. 
  Vite automatically scans the folder. If the file exists, it is instantly 
  available as a route.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. URL NORMALIZATION (The Trailing Slash Fix)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Issue**: Previously, `http://localhost:5175/hello/` (with a slash) would 
  fail with a 404 error, even if `hello.mdx` existed.
- **Fix**: The router in `main.ts` now automatically detects and removes 
  trailing slashes before looking for the content. This makes links much 
  harder to break.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. EXPLICIT ERROR REPORTING (Better Debugging)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Issue**: If a developer made a syntax error in an MDX file, the server 
  would silently ignore it and show a generic 404 page.
- **Fix**: The router now catches these errors and displays an explicit 
  **500 Internal Server Error** with a clear message. You'll know exactly 
  WHEN it broke and WHICH path was responsible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. LAYOUT FLEXIBILITY (Removal of "Straightjacket")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Old way**: `main.ts` forced every MDX page into a specific narrow column 
  (`max-w-screen-md`).
- **New way**: The hardcoded layout was removed. Your MDX pages can now take 
  the full width of the screen, or you can wrap them in your own custom 
  `.tsx` wrapper components for maximum design control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:
The MDX system is now a professional-grade "Auto-Routing" engine. You just 
focus on writing content, and the engine handles the discovery and delivery!
