EXPLANATION: THE MDX ROUTING FIX
================================================================================

We recently updated how MDX files are loaded to solve a critical issue with
the Vite build system. This document explains why we made that change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. THE PROBLEM: DYNAMIC IMPORTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, we tried to load files using a "template literal" like this:
   import(`./routes${path}.mdx`)

Vite (our build tool) scans your code BEFORE the app runs to see which files
to include in the bundle. Because "${path}" is a variable that changes at 
runtime, Vite cannot know which files to bundle. This resulted in "404 Not Found"
errors even if the file existed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. THE SOLUTION: STATIC REGISTRY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We created a central registry file called "mdx-routes.ts". 
Every MDX route must be listed here explicitly.

Example entry:
   "/hello": () => import("./routes/hello.mdx")

Because the path string is written out completely ("./routes/hello.mdx"),
Vite can clearly see it and knows exactly which file to include in the build.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. HOW IT WIRES TOGETHER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. THE REGISTRY (mdx-routes.ts):
   Acts as a map between a URL path and the actual file on disk.

2. THE HANDLER (main.ts):
   Uses a "catch-all" route. When you visit a page, it looks up the path in 
   the registry. If found, it calls the import function and renders the content.

3. THE RENDERING:
   The content is automatically wrapped in a <div> with standard padding to 
   ensure your documentation looks consistent and readable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. SUMMARY OF CHANGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* MOVED registry logic out of main.ts into its own file for clarity.
* REPLACED dynamic paths with explicit import functions.
* ADDED error handling to prevent the server from crashing if a file fails to load.
