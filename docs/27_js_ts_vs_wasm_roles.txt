CAN JS/TS COMPILE TO WASM?
================================================================================

To answer your question: **Generally, No.** 

JavaScript and TypeScript are "High-Level" languages, while WASM is for 
"Low-Level" binary code. They are designed for different jobs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- JAVASCRIPT / TYPESCRIPT: 
  These are "Garbage Collected" and "Dynamic." They need a complex engine 
  (like V8) to manage memory and decide what data types are being used 
  while the program is running.
  
- WASM: 
  This is "Manual" and "Static." It expects the programmer to manage 
  memory and define exactly what every piece of data is before it runs.

Because JS/TS are so "smart" and "flexible," they carry too much extra 
weight to be turned into a simple, fast WASM binary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. THE EXCEPTION: ASSEMBLYSCRIPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a special language called **AssemblyScript**. 

- It looks exactly like TypeScript.
- BUT it has strict rules (for example, you must define if a number is an 
  integer or a decimal).
- IT COMPILES TO WASM.

This is the only way to write "TypeScript-ish" code and get a `.wasm` file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. THE MAGIC OF THE "GLUE"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of turning JS/TS into WASM, we usually do the opposite:

1. We use **Rust or C++** for the heavy math/logic (.wasm).
2. We use **JavaScript or TypeScript** to talk to the browser's screen (.js/.ts).

Think of it like a car:
- The **WASM** is the powerful Engine (Rust/C++).
- The **JavaScript** is the Dashboard and the Steering Wheel. 

You need both to drive, but you wouldn't try to build a steering wheel 
out of engine pistons!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:
Standard Javascript and TypeScript cannot be turned into WASM. They are the 
"Control Room" that manages the WASM "Engines."
