# Solving One-Step Equations

To solve an equation, we want to get the variable (like $x$) all by itself on one side of the equals sign. We do this by using **Inverse Operations**.

### The Inverse Rule
- The inverse of **Addition** is **Subtraction**.
- The inverse of **Subtraction** is **Addition**.
- The inverse of **Multiplication** is **Division**.
- The inverse of **Division** is **Multiplication**.

## Interactive Practice

This exercise is **Procedurally Generated**. Every time you refresh, the numbers will change, but the difficulty stays the same!

<ProceduralExercise
  id="one-step-add-sub"
  type="numeric"
  blueprint={{
    variables: {
      x: "random(1, 15)",
      a: "random(1, 20)",
      op: "choice(['+', '-'])"
    },
    equation: "op === '+' ? `x + ${a} = ${x + a}` : `x - ${a} = ${x - a}`",
    solution: "x"
  }}
  question="Solve for $x$:"
/>

{/*
  How the generator works (Answer-First):
  1. It picks the answer 'x' first (1 to 15).
  2. It picks a constant 'a' (1 to 20).
  3. It calculates the result 'C' automatically.
  4. The student always gets a clean integer answer!
