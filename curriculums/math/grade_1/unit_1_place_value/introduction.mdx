# Unit 1: The Magic of Place Value

> **Grade:** 1 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Subject:** Mathematics &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Estimated Time:** 3–4 weeks

## 🌟 Welcome Message

Welcome to **Grade 1 Mathematics!** You are about to unlock one of the most powerful secrets in all of math: **Place Value**.

Right now, you already know how to count on your fingers. That is amazing! But what happens when you need to count something much, much bigger — like all the apples in a grocery store, or all the steps in a tall building? You would run out of fingers very quickly!

This is the problem that mathematicians solved thousands of years ago. Their brilliant answer? **Group things by tens.** This unit teaches you exactly how — and why — that system works.

## ❓ Why Should We Learn This?

Here are some real questions that Place Value helps you answer every single day:

- **Your piggy bank:** You have $2$ dimes and $5$ pennies. How many cents is that?
  $$2 \text{ dimes} + 5 \text{ pennies} = 20\text{¢} + 5\text{¢} = 25\text{¢}$$

- **Sharing crayons:** There are $34$ crayons in a box. Can every one of the $30$ students get one?
  $$34 > 30 \; \checkmark \quad \text{Yes, there are enough!}$$

- **Counting your birthday candies:** You count $10$ red candies, $10$ green candies, and $7$ yellow. How many in total?
  $$10 + 10 + 7 = \underbrace{2 \text{ Tens}}_{}\ +\ \underbrace{7 \text{ Ones}}_{} = 27$$

Every single one of these answers uses **Place Value thinking** — and by the end of this unit, they will all feel easy.

## 🚀 What is the Benefit?

Place Value is not just a math topic. It is the **foundation** that all other math is built on. Here is a sneak peek at how it will help you for years to come:

| Future Skill | How Place Value Helps |
|---|---|
| **Addition (Grade 1–2)** | Add $34 + 25$ by adding Tens then Ones separately |
| **Subtraction (Grade 1–2)** | Subtract $58 - 23$ digit by digit in each column |
| **Multiplication (Grade 3)** | Understand why $3 \times 10 = 30$ |
| **Decimals (Grade 4–5)** | The Tenths and Hundredths places work exactly like Tens and Ones |
| **Large Numbers (Grade 3+)** | Hundreds, Thousands, Millions all use the same bundling idea |

You are not just learning about $34$ and $72$. You are building the mental scaffolding that will hold up **everything** you ever learn in math.

## 🔍 The Big Idea: Position Matters!

The same digit can mean totally different things depending on **where it stands**.

Look at what happens to the digit $5$:

| Number | Where is the $5$? | Value of the $5$ |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| $5$ | Ones place | $5$ |
| $50$ | Tens place | $50$ |
| $52$ | Tens place | $50$ |
| $25$ | Ones place | $5$ |

The number $52$ and the number $25$ use the same two digits — $2$ and $5$ — but they have completely different values! A $5$ on the left is worth **ten times more** than a $5$ on the right.

$$52 = 50 + 2 \qquad \text{vs} \qquad 25 = 20 + 5$$

$$52 \neq 25$$

This is why we call it **Place Value** — the *value* depends on the *place*.

## 🗺️ Unit Roadmap

This unit has four topics that build on each other like steps on a staircase:

```
Step 4: ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
        │ Topic 4: Adding & Subtracting Tens   │  ← Use what you know to do fast math
        └──────────────────────────────────────┘
Step 3: ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
        │ Topic 3: Comparing Numbers           │  ← Which number is bigger?
        └──────────────────────────────────────┘
Step 2: ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
        │ Topic 2: Tens and Ones               │  ← Break numbers apart
        └──────────────────────────────────────┘
Step 1: ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
        │ Topic 1: Counting to 120             │  ← Know your numbers first
        └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

You must master each step before climbing to the next one. That is why we start with counting — you cannot break apart a number you don't know yet!

## 🎯 Unit Goals (What You Will Be Able to Do)

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

1. **Count to $120$** starting from any number, forward and backward.
   $$\text{Example: } 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101 \ldots$$

2. **Identify Tens and Ones** in any two-digit number and write it in expanded form.
   $$85 = \underbrace{8}_{\text{Tens}} \text{ Tens} + \underbrace{5}_{\text{Ones}} \text{ Ones} = 80 + 5$$

3. **Compare two numbers** using $<$, $>$, and $=$.
   $$47 < 74 \qquad 90 > 89 \qquad 55 = 55$$

4. **Add and subtract multiples of $10$** mentally.
   $$36 + 20 = 56 \qquad 81 - 30 = 51$$

## 📖 Unit Vocabulary

These are the key words we will use throughout the unit. Review them often!

| Word | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Digit** | The ten symbols: $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ | The number $47$ has two digits: $4$ and $7$ |
| **Place Value** | The value a digit has because of its position | The $4$ in $47$ means $40$, not just $4$ |
| **Tens place** | The left digit in a two-digit number | In $63$, the $6$ is in the Tens place |
| **Ones place** | The right digit in a two-digit number | In $63$, the $3$ is in the Ones place |
| **Standard form** | A number written normally | $47$ |
| **Expanded form** | A number split to show each place's worth | $40 + 7$ |
| **Greater than ($>$)** | The left number is bigger | $9 > 5$ |
| **Less than ($<$)** | The left number is smaller | $2 < 8$ |
| **Equal to ($=$)** | Both numbers are the same | $6 = 6$ |

## 🧰 What Tools Will We Use?

Throughout this unit, we will use these learning tools:

- **Base-10 blocks:** Rods (Tens) and small cubes (Ones) to physically build numbers.
- **Place Value chart:** A two-column table to organise digits.
- **100/120 number chart:** A grid showing all numbers; great for spotting patterns.
- **Number line:** A line with numbers in order; helps us compare and count on.
