Here they are with their names and a picture:

## 📏 The Number Line 1 to 9

A **number line** shows numbers in order from left to right.
Numbers to the **right** are always **bigger**.

$$1 \;—\; 2 \;—\; 3 \;—\; 4 \;—\; 5 \;—\; 6 \;—\; 7 \;—\; 8 \;—\; 9$$

- Going **right** means getting larger: $3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5$
- Going **left** means getting smaller: $7 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 5$

## ⚖️ Comparing Numbers: More, Less, or Equal?

We use three symbols when comparing:

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|:---:|---|---|
| $>$ | **greater than** (more) | $7 > 4$ |
| `\<` | **less than** (fewer) | $2 < 6$ |
| $=$ | **equal to** (same amount) | $5 = 5$ |

> **Memory trick:** The symbol's open mouth always faces the **bigger** number.
