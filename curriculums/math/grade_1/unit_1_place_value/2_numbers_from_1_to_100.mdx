# Topic 2: Numbers from 1 to 100

> **Learning Goal:** Count to $100$ forward and backward, and identify patterns on a hundreds chart.

## 🗺️ The Hundreds Chart

A **hundreds chart** is a grid of numbers from $1$ to $100$. It helps us see patterns in counting.

* **Moving Right ($\rightarrow$):** Add $1$ (gets bigger by one)
* **Moving Left ($\leftarrow$):** Subtract $1$ (gets smaller by one)
* **Moving Down ($\downarrow$):** Add $10$ (gets bigger by ten)
* **Moving Up ($\uparrow$):** Subtract $10$ (gets smaller by ten)

### Example: Finding numbers around $45$

If you are standing on $45$:
* One more is $46$
* One less is $44$
* Ten more (down one row) is $55$
* Ten less (up one row) is $35$

## 🏃 Skip Counting

**Skip counting** is counting by a number that is not $1$. It is a much faster way to count a large group of objects!

### Skip Counting by $10$s
This is the fastest way to reach $100$. Notice how every number ends with a $0$!

$$10, \quad 20, \quad 30, \quad 40, \quad 50, \quad 60, \quad 70, \quad 80, \quad 90, \quad 100$$

### Skip Counting by $5$s
Every number will end with either a $5$ or a $0$.

$$5, \quad 10, \quad 15, \quad 20, \quad 25, \quad 30, \quad 35, \quad 40, \dots$$

### Skip Counting by $2$s (Even Numbers)
These numbers always end in $0, 2, 4, 6,$ or $8$.

$$2, \quad 4, \quad 6, \quad 8, \quad 10, \quad 12, \quad 14, \quad 16, \dots$$
