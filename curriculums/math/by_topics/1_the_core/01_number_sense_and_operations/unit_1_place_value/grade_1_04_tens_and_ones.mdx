# Topic 4: Tens and Ones

> **Learning Goal:** Count groups of ten and leftovers (ones) to build a two-digit number.

## 🏗️ Building Numbers

Remember our blocks from the last lesson? Let's use them to build numbers!

**Goal:** Build the number $\mathbf{42}$

First, let's look at the digits:
$$ \text{Tens: } 4 $$
$$ \text{Ones: } 2 $$

So, we need:
1.  **$4$ Ten sticks**: $10, 20, 30, 40$
2.  **$2$ One blocks**: $41, 42$

$$ 4 \text{ Tens} + 2 \text{ Ones} = 42 $$

## 🕵️‍♂️ Decomposing Numbers

**Decomposing** is a fancy math word that means breaking a number apart into its Tens and Ones.

### Example 1: Break apart $76$
1. Cover the Ones digit (the $6$). What's left? A $7$ in the Tens place. That means **$70$**.
2. Look at the Ones digit. It is a **$6$**.
3. Put it together as an addition problem:
$$ 76 = 70 + 6 $$

### Example 2: Break apart $15$
$$ 15 = 10 + 5 $$

## 🎯 Practice Time

**Level 1 — Read the model:**
1. I have $6$ Ten sticks and $8$ loose One blocks. What number am I holding?
2. I have $2$ Ten sticks and $0$ loose One blocks. What number am I holding?

**Level 2 — Decompose the number:**
3. $39 =$ \_\_\_ $+ 9$
4. $91 = 90 +$ \_\_\_
5. $55 =$ \_\_\_ $+$ \_\_\_

> **Answers:** 1) 68 &nbsp; 2) 20 &nbsp; 3) 30 &nbsp; 4) 1 &nbsp; 5) 50 + 5
