## 📚 Vocabulary

| Word | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Tens** | Groups of $10$ equal things | $30 = 3$ tens |
| **Ones** | Single items (not grouped) | $7 = 7$ ones |
| **Two-digit number** | A number with a tens digit **and** a ones digit | $47$: tens digit $= 4$, ones digit $= 7$ |
| **Hundreds chart** | A $10 \times 10$ grid showing $1$–$100$ | Great for spotting patterns |
| **Skip counting** | Counting by a number other than $1$ | $10, 20, 30, \ldots$ |
| **Ascending** | Getting bigger, going up | $12 < 34 < 56$ |
| **Descending** | Getting smaller, going down | $90 > 60 > 30$ |

## 🏗️ Building Two-Digit Numbers: Tens and Ones

Every number from $10$ to $99$ is made of **two parts**: a **tens digit** and a **ones digit**.

$$\underbrace{4}_{\text{tens}} \underbrace{7}_{\text{ones}} \quad = \quad 4 \times 10 + 7 \times 1 \quad = \quad 40 + 7 \quad = \quad 47$$

Think of the tens digit as telling you **how many full groups of 10** you have, and the ones digit as **how many extras** are left over.

| Number | Tens | Ones | Expanded Form |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| $15$ | $1$ | $5$ | $10 + 5$ |
| $23$ | $2$ | $3$ | $20 + 3$ |
| $40$ | $4$ | $0$ | $40 + 0$ |
| $68$ | $6$ | $8$ | $60 + 8$ |
| $99$ | $9$ | $9$ | $90 + 9$ |

> 💡 **Special case:** Numbers from $1$ to $9$ have **zero tens** and some ones.  
> $\;7 = 0 \times 10 + 7 = 7$ ones.  
> The number $100$ has **one hundred**, zero tens, and zero ones: $\;100 = 1 \times 100$.

## 🗺️ The Hundreds Chart

A **hundreds chart** is a $10 \times 10$ grid of numbers from $1$ to $100$.
It helps us see patterns, count faster, and find neighbors of any number.

| Arrow | What it means | Rule |
|:---:|---|---|
| $\rightarrow$ | Move **right** | $+1$ (one more) |
| $\leftarrow$ | Move **left** | $-1$ (one less) |
| $\downarrow$ | Move **down** | $+10$ (ten more) |
| $\uparrow$ | Move **up** | $-10$ (ten less) |

### Example: Finding the four neighbors of $45$

$$\text{One more: } 45 + 1 = 46$$
$$\text{One less: } 45 - 1 = 44$$
$$\text{Ten more: } 45 + 10 = 55$$
$$\text{Ten less: } 45 - 10 = 35$$

So on the hundreds chart, $45$ is surrounded by $44$ (left), $46$ (right), $35$ (above), $55$ (below).

### Patterns you can spot on the chart

- **Column patterns:** Every number in the **last column** ends in $0$ (e.g., $10, 20, 30, \ldots$). Every number in the column before it ends in $9$.
- **Row patterns:** The tens digit stays the same across each row (e.g., row 4: $31, 32, 33, \ldots, 40$).
- **Diagonal patterns:** Moving diagonally down-right adds $11$ each step: $\;11, 22, 33, 44, \ldots$

## 🏃 Skip Counting

**Skip counting** is counting by a fixed number other than $1$. It is much faster than counting by ones!

### Skip Counting by $10$s

The quickest path to $100$ — every result ends in $0$.

$$10, \quad 20, \quad 30, \quad 40, \quad 50, \quad 60, \quad 70, \quad 80, \quad 90, \quad 100$$

Each step: $+10$.  
On the hundreds chart, move **down one row** each time.

### Skip Counting by $5$s

Every result ends in $5$ or $0$.

$$5, \quad 10, \quad 15, \quad 20, \quad 25, \quad 30, \quad 35, \quad 40, \quad 45, \quad 50, \ldots, \quad 100$$

Each step: $+5$.  
Notice: counting by $5$s reaches $100$ in **20 steps**; counting by $10$s reaches $100$ in only **10 steps**.

### Skip Counting by $2$s (Even Numbers)

Every result ends in $0, 2, 4, 6,$ or $8$.

$$2, \quad 4, \quad 6, \quad 8, \quad 10, \quad 12, \quad 14, \quad 16, \quad 18, \quad 20, \ldots$$

Each step: $+2$.  
These are called **even numbers**. Numbers you skip over ($1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots$) are called **odd numbers**.

### Quick Comparison

| Skip-count by | Steps needed to reach $100$ | Ending digits |
|:---:|:---:|---|
| $2$ | $50$ | $0, 2, 4, 6, 8$ |
| $5$ | $20$ | $0$ or $5$ |
| $10$ | $10$ | $0$ only |

## 📊 Counting Forward and Backward

### Forward from any starting number

Start at $37$, count forward by $1$s:

$$37, \; 38, \; 39, \; 40, \; 41, \; 42, \ldots$$

Notice: we moved from the **30s** into the **40s** — the tens digit increased by $1$ when we passed $40$.

### Backward from any starting number

Start at $52$, count backward by $1$s:

$$52, \; 51, \; 50, \; 49, \; 48, \ldots$$

Notice: we moved from the **50s** into the **40s** — the tens digit decreased by $1$ when we passed $49$.

### Before, After, and Between (Two-Digit Numbers)

| Relationship | Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **One before** | Subtract $1$ | One before $70$ is $69$ |
| **One after** | Add $1$ | One after $99$ is $100$ |
| **Between** | The number in the middle | $\;54$ is between $53$ and $55$ |

## ⚖️ Comparing Two-Digit Numbers

### Step-by-Step Strategy

1. **Compare the tens digits first.**
   - If they are different, the number with the **larger tens digit** is bigger.
2. **If the tens digits are equal, compare the ones digits.**
   - The number with the **larger ones digit** is bigger.

### Examples

**Compare $63$ and $47$:**
$$6 \text{ tens} > 4 \text{ tens} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 63 > 47$$

**Compare $52$ and $58$:**
$$\text{Tens: } 5 = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{compare ones: } 2 < 8 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 52 < 58$$

**Compare $76$ and $76$:**
$$\text{Tens: } 7 = 7, \quad \text{Ones: } 6 = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 76 = 76$$

## 🔢 Ordering Two-Digit Numbers

**Put $\{34, 79, 52, 17\}$ in ascending order:**

Step 1 — Tens digits: $1 < 3 < 5 < 7$  
Step 2 — Write in order:

$$17 < 34 < 52 < 79$$

**Put $\{88, 21, 45, 60\}$ in descending order:**

$$88 > 60 > 45 > 21$$
