# Topic 3: Understanding Place Value

> **Learning Goal:** Understand that $10$ ones make $1$ ten, and identify the value of digits in two-digit numbers.

## 🏠 The Place Value House

Imagine a house with two rooms: the **Tens Room** and the **Ones Room**.
Each digit in a two-digit number lives in its own room. The room tells us how much the digit is worth!

Let's look at the number $\mathbf{34}$:

| Tens | Ones |
|:---:|:---:|
| **3** | **4** |

* The $\mathbf{3}$ is in the **Tens** column. It means $3$ groups of ten, which is $30$.
* The $\mathbf{4}$ is in the **Ones** column. It means $4$ single ones, which is $4$.
* $30 + 4 = 34$

## 🧱 Blocks and Bundles

We often use blocks to show place value:
* **One small block ($\square$)** = $1$ One
* **A stick of 10 blocks ($\blacksquare\blacksquare\dots$)** = $1$ Ten

If you have $10$ loose ones ($\square\square\square \dots$), you can snap them together to make $1$ Ten stick!

**Example:** What number is $2$ Tens and $5$ Ones?
$$ \text{Tens: } 2 \rightarrow 20 $$
$$ \text{Ones: } 5 \rightarrow 5 $$
$$ \mathbf{25} $$

## 🤔 Tricky Zeros

What happens if a room is empty? We use a **$0$** to hold the place!

Look at the number $\mathbf{40}$:

| Tens | Ones |
|:---:|:---:|
| **4** | **0** |

This means exactly $4$ Tens and *zero* extra Ones. Without the zero, it would just look like a $4$!

## 🎯 Practice Time

**Level 1 — Find the value:**
1. In the number $\mathbf{82}$, which digit is in the Tens place?
2. In the number $\mathbf{19}$, how many Ones are there?

**Level 2 — Build the number:**
3. $5 \text{ Tens} + 3 \text{ Ones} = \underline{\quad\quad}$
4. $9 \text{ Tens} + 0 \text{ Ones} = \underline{\quad\quad}$
