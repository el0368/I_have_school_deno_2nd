# Topic 1: Numbers from 1 to 9

> **Learning Goal:** Count, read, write, order, and compare the numbers $1$ through $9$.
> By the end of this topic you will be able to:
> - Say and write every number from $1$ to $9$
> - Show each number with objects, fingers, or tally marks
> - Place any two numbers on a number line and say which one is greater
> - Use the symbols $ < $, $ > $, and $ = $ correctly
> - Name the number that comes **before**, **after**, and **between** any two single-digit numbers

## 📚 Vocabulary

| Word | Meaning | Quick Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Number** | A way of describing how many things are in a group | There are $4$ apples in the bowl |
| **Numeral** | The written symbol we use to show a number | The numeral for seven is $7$ |
| **Digit** | Any single symbol $0$–$9$; every number from $1$–$9$ has exactly **one** digit | $5$ is a single digit |
| **Count** | Say numbers in order to find how many | $1, 2, 3 \ldots$ |
| **Order** | Arrange numbers from smallest to largest (ascending) or largest to smallest (descending) | $2, 5, 8$ is ascending order |
| **More / Greater** | A bigger amount | $7$ is more than $4$ |
| **Less / Fewer** | A smaller amount | $3$ is less than $6$ |
| **Equal** | Exactly the same amount | $5 = 5$ |
| **Before** | The number just to the left on the number line | $4$ comes before $5$ |
| **After** | The number just to the right on the number line | $6$ comes after $5$ |
| **Between** | A number that sits between two other numbers | $5$ is between $4$ and $6$ |
| **Tally mark** | A stroke used to count; every 5th mark crosses the previous four | `||||` = $5$ |

## 🔢 The Nine Single-Digit Numbers

There are exactly **nine** counting numbers before we reach $10$.
Every number from $1$ to $9$ uses just **one digit**.

$$1, \quad 2, \quad 3, \quad 4, \quad 5, \quad 6, \quad 7, \quad 8, \quad 9$$

Here they are with their names, objects, and tally marks:

| Numeral | Word | Objects | Tally Marks | Real-World Example |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| $1$ | one | ⭐ | `|` | $1$ sun in the sky |
| $2$ | two | ⭐ ⭐ | `||` | $2$ eyes on your face |
| $3$ | three | ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ | `|||` | $3$ wheels on a tricycle |
| $4$ | four | ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ | `||||` | $4$ legs on a dog |
| $5$ | five | ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ | `||||` (crossed) | $5$ fingers on one hand |
| $6$ | six | ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ | `|||| |` | $6$ sides on a cube |
| $7$ | seven | ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ | `|||| ||` | $7$ days in a week |
| $8$ | eight | ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ | `|||| |||` | $8$ legs on a spider |
| $9$ | nine | ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ | `|||| ||||` | $9$ players on a baseball team |

> 💡 **Why do we start counting at $1$ and not $0$?**
> $0$ means "nothing at all." When you count objects, you start when you have *at least one*. You will learn about $0$ very soon!

## 📏 The Number Line 1 to 9

A **number line** shows numbers in order from left to right.
Numbers to the **right** are always **bigger**.
Numbers to the **left** are always **smaller**.

$$1 \;-\; 2 \;-\; 3 \;-\; 4 \;-\; 5 \;-\; 6 \;-\; 7 \;-\; 8 \;-\; 9$$

- Going **right** (+1 each step) means getting **larger**: $3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5$
- Going **left** (−1 each step) means getting **smaller**: $7 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 5$

### Before, After, and Between

| Relationship | How to find it | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Before** (one less) | Move **one step left** | The number before $6$ is $6 - 1 = 5$ |
| **After** (one more) | Move **one step right** | The number after $6$ is $6 + 1 = 7$ |
| **Between** | Sits in the middle of two neighbors | $6$ is between $5$ and $7$ |

**Try it:** What number is between $3$ and $5$?
> $3 \;-\; ? \;-\; 5$
> Answer: $4$, because $3 < 4 < 5$.

## 🧮 Two Ways to Show a Number

### Way 1 — Fingers (Body Count)
Hold up fingers one at a time while counting aloud.
$1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ — one hand.
$6, 7, 8, 9$ — add fingers on the second hand.

### Way 2 — Tally Marks (Paper Count)
Draw one vertical line for each object.
Every time you reach $5$, draw a diagonal line **across** the previous 4 marks.

$$\underbrace{| \; | \; | \; ||}_{5} \;\; \underbrace{| \; | \; |}_{3} \quad = \quad 8$$

## ⚖️ Comparing Numbers: Greater, Less, or Equal?

We use three symbols when comparing two numbers:

| Symbol | Read as | Meaning | Example | Read aloud |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| $>$ | "is greater than" | Left number is **bigger** | $7 > 4$ | "Seven is greater than four" |
| $<$ | "is less than" | Left number is **smaller** | $2 < 6$ | "Two is less than six" |
| $=$ | "is equal to" | Both numbers are the **same** | $5 = 5$ | "Five is equal to five" |

> 🐊 **Alligator trick:** Imagine the symbol is a hungry alligator's mouth.  
> The alligator **always eats the bigger number** — its mouth opens toward the larger side!  
> $3 < 8$ — the mouth opens toward $8$ (the bigger meal).  
> $9 > 2$ — the mouth opens toward $9$.

### Step-by-Step: How to Compare Two Numbers

**Compare $6$ and $4$:**

1. Find both numbers on the number line.
2. $6$ is to the **right** of $4$.
3. Therefore $6$ is **greater**: $\;6 > 4$.

**Compare $3$ and $7$:**

1. Find both numbers on the number line.
2. $3$ is to the **left** of $7$.
3. Therefore $3$ is **less**: $\;3 < 7$.

## 🔢 Ordering Numbers

**Ascending order** = smallest to largest (going up ↑):

$$2, \quad 5, \quad 7, \quad 9$$

**Descending order** = largest to smallest (going down ↓):

$$9, \quad 7, \quad 5, \quad 2$$

### Example: Put $4, 1, 8, 3$ in ascending order.

Step 1 — Find them on the number line: $1 \;-\; 3 \;-\; 4 \;-\; 8$  
Step 2 — Write from left to right: $\;1 < 3 < 4 < 8$ ✓

## 🌟 Odd and Even: A First Peek

Numbers from $1$ to $9$ split into two families:

| Family | Numbers | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| **Even** | $2, \quad 4, \quad 6, \quad 8$ | Can be split into **two equal groups** |
| **Odd** | $1, \quad 3, \quad 5, \quad 7, \quad 9$ | Always **one left over** when split in two |

**Example — Is $6$ even or odd?**

$$6 = 3 + 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{two equal groups of } 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \textbf{even}$$

**Example — Is $5$ even or odd?**

$$5 = 2 + 2 + 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{one is left over} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \textbf{odd}$$

## 🎯 Practice Time!

### Level 1 — Fill in the missing number

1. $\_\_\_ , \; 3, \; 4$ → the number **before** $3$ is \_\_\_
2. $7, \; \_\_\_ , \; 9$ → the number **between** $7$ and $9$ is \_\_\_
3. $5, \; 6, \; \_\_\_$ → the number **after** $6$ is \_\_\_

### Level 2 — Fill in the symbol ($<$, $>$, or $=$)

1. $3 \;\; \_\_\_ \;\; 7$
2. $9 \;\; \_\_\_ \;\; 9$
3. $5 \;\; \_\_\_ \;\; 2$
4. $4 \;\; \_\_\_ \;\; 6$
5. $8 \;\; \_\_\_ \;\; 1$

### Level 3 — Put in ascending order

1. $7, \; 2, \; 5$ → \_\_\_ , \_\_\_ , \_\_\_
2. $9, \; 3, \; 6, \; 1$ → \_\_\_ , \_\_\_ , \_\_\_ , \_\_\_

### Level 4 — Word Problems

1. Maya has $4$ crayons. Leo has $7$ crayons. Who has **more**? Write a number sentence using $>$ or $<$.
2. A dog has $\_\_\_$ legs, and a spider has $\_\_\_$ legs. Which has **fewer** legs? Write a number sentence.
3. Sam counted $3$ red balls and $3$ blue balls. Are they **equal**? Write a number sentence.

## ✅ Answer Key

**Level 1:** $\quad 2 \quad | \quad 8 \quad | \quad 7$

**Level 2:**
1. $3 < 7$
2. $9 = 9$
3. $5 > 2$
4. $4 < 6$
5. $8 > 1$

**Level 3:**
1. $2, \; 5, \; 7$
2. $1, \; 3, \; 6, \; 9$

**Level 4:**
1. Leo has more: $\;7 > 4$
2. A dog has $4$ legs, a spider has $8$ legs: $\;4 < 8$, so the dog has fewer.
3. Yes: $\;3 = 3$

## 📝 Summary

| What you learned | Key idea |
|---|---|
| The nine counting numbers | $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ — each uses one digit |
| Number line direction | Right = bigger, Left = smaller |
| Before / After / Between | Subtract $1$, Add $1$, or find the middle |
| Comparing | $>$ (greater), $<$ (less), $=$ (equal) |
| Ordering | Ascending ($1 \to 9$) or Descending ($9 \to 1$) |
| Odd vs Even | Even splits equally; odd has one left over |
