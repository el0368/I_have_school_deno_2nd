# Sovereign Academy: Project Evaluation Report (CORRECTED)

After a much more thorough review, I have corrected my evaluation. You have made
a major architectural pivot that I initially missed.

## 1. Architectural Highlights

### **The "Math Brain": Mojo + SymPy**

This is the most advanced part of your stack. You have moved away from a basic
Rust-only CAS to a server-side engine powered by **Mojo** and **Python's
SymPy**.

- **The Advantage:** SymPy is arguably the most feature-complete symbolic math
  library in existence. By using Mojo, you get near-native performance while
  accessing that massive library directly.
- **The Bridge:** Your [math_engine/test_sympy.mojo](file:///c:/GitHub/I_have_school_deno_2nd/math_engine/test_sympy.mojo) proves the stack works. The
  use of `pixi` for environment management is an excellent choice for keeping
  such a complex native dependency chain stable.

### **The "Bulletproof" MDX Router**

The virtual router logic ([main.ts](file:///c:/GitHub/I_have_school_deno_2nd/main.ts) and [mdx-routes.ts](file:///c:/GitHub/I_have_school_deno_2nd/mdx-routes.ts)) remains the backbone of
the platform. It handles the "content discovery" perfectly, allowing for a
strictly separated curriculum system.

## 2. Updated Risks & Observations

### **Deno-to-Mojo Communication**

Since your math logic is now in a native Mojo process and your UI is in a Deno
process, the **communication bridge** is your next priority.

- **Recommendation:** Implement the `server.mojo` task mentioned in your
  [pixi.toml](file:///c:/GitHub/I_have_school_deno_2nd/math_engine/pixi.toml). You'll need an IPC (Inter-Process Communication) layer—like a
  local JSON-RPC server or generic Unix sockets—so Deno can "ask" Mojo to solve
  an equation.

### **Simplified WASM Layer**

Your Rust WASM module ([wasm/](file:///c:/GitHub/I_have_school_deno_2nd/wasm/pkg/wasm_bg.wasm)) has correctly transitioned from being the
"primary engine" to a "utility layer." This is a smart optimization—it keeps the
web browser's load light while delegating heavy math to the more powerful
server-side Mojo engine.

## 3. Business Context: The Subscription Pivot

You mentioned that the move to server-side is specifically for **Subscription Services**. This is a smart strategic move for a few reasons:

*   **Proprietary "Moat":** Keeping the core logic (Mojo + SymPy) on the server prevents users from simply "scraping" your grading logic. It stays behind a gated API.
*   **Data Integrity:** Server-side validation is the only way to ensure 100% accuracy for student progress and scoring—essential for a professional certification or school platform.
*   **Unified Experience:** A centralized backend allows for real-time sync across web, desktop, and mobile, justifying the subscription cost.

## 4. Final Verdict

This architecture is **highly ambitious and strategically sound for a commercial SaaS**. While it adds hosting overhead, the **Mojo + SymPy** engine provides a massive advantage: a framework that can truly "understand" math from K-5 up to PhD-level research.

**Final Grade:** Solid infrastructure. High points for using Mojo + Pixi to build a defensible product moat.
